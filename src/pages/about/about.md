A playground for experimenting with:

1. ES6 via Babel (throughout the stack, including tests)
	1. Modules
	2. Object property value shorthand and destructuring
    3. Custom `Symbol.iterator` with array spreads
	4. Classes and inheritance
	5. Block-scoped `let` and immutable `const`
	5. Etc.
2. ES6-ified React via Babel
3. Webpack as module (and asset) loader and builder
